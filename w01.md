# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Virtualization](https://www.kelsercorp.com/blog/the-7-types-of-virtualization)<br>
Virtualization is a surprisingly simple concept…at least in theory. The simple explanation is that you create a virtual version of something that’s generally used for some type of execution. For example, if you were to partition a basic hard drive to create two hard drives, then they would be two ‘virtualized hard drives,’ as the hardware is technically a single hard drive that was digitally separated into two. There are 7 types of virtualization, OS Virtualization—aka Virtual Machines, Application-Server Virtualization, Application Virtualization, Administrative Virtualization, Network Virtualization, Hardware Virtualization, and Storage Virtualization.

2. [Bash Scripting Tutorials](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’. This website is pretty good to learn basic bash scripting.

3. [Sed Tutorials](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html)<br>
sed ("stream editor") is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965–66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and "stream editing" include AWK and Perl.

4. [awk Tutorials](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html)<br>
Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports.The awk command programming language requires no compiling, and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 

5. [Linux vs Windows](https://www.guru99.com/linux-differences.html)<br>
This site simply tells you about the differences between Linux and Windows.

6. [Regular Expression](https://linuxtechlab.com/bash-scripting-learn-use-regex-basics/)<br>
Regular expressions or regex or regexp are basically strings of character that define a search pattern, they can be used for performing ‘Search’ or ‘Search & Replace’ operations as well as can be used to validate a condition like a password policy etc. Regex is a very powerful tool that is available at our disposal & the best thing about using regex is that they can be used in almost every computer language. So if you are Bash Scripting or creating a Python program, we can use regex or we can also write a single line search query.

7. [Kernel](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-kernel-in-operating-system-and-what-are-the-various-types-of-kernel)<br>
A Kernel is a computer program that is the heart and core of an Operating System. Since the Operating System has control over the system so, the Kernel also has control over everything in the system. It is the most important part of an Operating System. Whenever a system starts, the Kernel is the first program that is loaded after the bootloader because the Kernel has to handle the rest of the thing of the system for the Operating System. The Kernel remains in the memory until the Operating System is shut-down.

8. [Memory vs Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-diff-ram-vs-storage)<br>
Your computer’s main memory is called RAM. You can think of it as a workspace the computer uses to get work done. When you double-click on an app, or open a document, or, well, do much of anything, RAM gets used to store that data while the computer is working on it. There’s also storage: a hard disk drive or solid state drive where data is recorded and can stay indefinitely, to be recalled as necessary. That might be a tax return, a poem in a word processor, or an email. By comparison, RAM is volatile — the information that’s put in there disappears when the power is turned off or when the computer is reset. Stuff written to disk stays there permanently until it’s erased, or until the storage medium fails.

9. [Java Virtual Machine](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/java-virtual-machine)<br>
Software from Oracle that converts a program in Java bytecode (intermediate language) into machine language and executes it. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the runtime engine of the Java Platform, which allows any program written in Java or other language compiled into Java bytecode to run on any computer that has a native JVM. JVMs run in both clients and servers, and the Web browser can activate the JVM when it encounters a Java applet.

10. [Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor)<br>
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” (or “hosted”). A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host’s hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.
