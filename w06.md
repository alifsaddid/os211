# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Understanding fork() system call for new process creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxTbksJ2fo)<br>
Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. This video explain about fork very clearly and by example.

2. [Threads in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/threads-in-operating-system)<br>
There is a way of thread execution inside the process of any operating system. Apart from this, there can be more than one thread inside a process. Thread is often referred to as a lightweight process. The process can be split down into so many threads. For example, in a browser, many tabs can be viewed as threads. MS Word uses many threads - formatting text from one thread, processing input from another thread, etc.

3. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation.

4. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism — A brief view](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
As explained before, concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction at the same time, meanwhile parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple CPUs at the exact same time.

5. [Zombie and Orphan Processes in Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/zombie-and-orphan-processes-in-linux)<br>
A zombie process is a process whose execution is completed but it still has an entry in the process table. Zombie processes usually occur for child processes, as the parent process still needs to read its child’s exit status. Orphan processes are those processes that are still running even though their parent process has terminated or finished. A process can be orphaned intentionally or unintentionally.

6. [What is a process?](https://geek-university.com/linux/what-is-a-process)<br>
An instance of a running program is called a process. Every time you run a shell command, a program is run and a process is created for it. Each process in Linux has a process id (PID) and it is associated with a particular user and group account.

7. [Multithreading in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/)<br>
Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and a multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two types of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.

8. [Multithreading in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multithreading-in-c)<br>
C does not contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. Instead, it relies entirely upon the operating system to provide this feature. A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution. This site gives you examples of programs with multithreading

9. [25 Multithreading Interview Questions (With Example Answers)](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/multithreading-interview-questions)<br>
Multithreading is an important concept in programming. If you interview for a position as a developer, you will likely be asked questions about multithreading. As part of your interview preparation, you should take time to review common multithreading questions. In this article, you will be given frequently asked multithreading interview questions with example answers.

10. [Use of fflush(stdin) in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/use-of-fflush-stdin-in-c)<br>
The function fflush(stdin) is used to flush the output buffer of the stream. It returns zero, if successful otherwise, returns EOF and feof error indicator is set. This article is a good read to learn about fflush stdin in C.
