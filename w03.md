# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [What is Linux File System? Easy Guide](https://likegeeks.com/linux-file-system/)<br>
Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer that is under the operating system that handles the positioning of your data on the storage; without it, the system cannot knows which file starts from where and ends where. This site is interesting because it gives me simple explanation about Linux File System.

2. [Directory Implementation](https://padakuu.com/article/93-directory-implementation)<br>
The selection of directory-allocation and directory-management algorithms significantly affects the efficiency, performance, and reliability of the file system. Directory implementation algorithms are classified according to the data structure used. There are two algorithms that are commonly used: Linear List and Hash Table. This site is interesting to me because it tells me how directory is implemented.

3. [Simple File System in User Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZn2_j_LbRY)<br>
FUSE is a userspace filesystem framework. It consists of a kernel module (fuse.ko), a userspace library (libfuse.*) and a mount utility (fusermount). One of the most important features of FUSE is allowing secure, non-privileged mounts. This opens up new possibilities for the use of filesystems. A good example is sshfs: a secure network filesystem using the sftp protocol. Userspace filesystem: A filesystem in which data and metadata are provided by an ordinary userspace process. The filesystem can be accessed normally through the kernel interface. This video is interesting because it shows me how to make a simple FUSE.

4. [System Protection in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-protection-in-operating-system/?ref=rp)<br>
Protection refers to a mechanism which controls the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system. We can take protection as a helper to multi programming operating system, so that many users might safely share a common logical name space such as directory or files. Need of Protection: To prevent the access of unauthorized users and to ensure that each active programs or processes in the system uses resources only as the stated policy, To improve reliability by detecting latent errors. This site is interesting because it tells me about System Protection in Operating System

5. [Multithreading in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/)<br>
A thread is a path which is followed during a program’s execution. Majority of programs written now a days run as a single thread.Lets say, for example a program is not capable of reading keystrokes while making drawings. These tasks cannot be executed by the program at the same time. This problem can be solved through multitasking so that two or more tasks can be executed simultaneously. Multitasking is of two types: Processor based and thread based. Processor based multitasking is totally managed by the OS, however multitasking through multithreading can be controlled by the programmer to some extent. The concept of multi-threading needs proper understanding of these two terms – a process and a thread. A process is a program being executed. A process can be further divided into independent units known as threads. A thread is like a small light-weight process within a process. Or we can say a collection of threads is what is known as a process.

6. [TAR File (What It Is and How to Open One](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
TAR, short for Tape Archive, and sometimes referred to as tarball, a file that has the TAR file extension is a file in the Consolidated Unix Archive format. A program or command that can open archives is needed to open a TAR file. This site is interesting because it helps me to unzip a tarball file.

7. [ASC File Extension - What Is and How to Open One](https://fileinfo.com/extension/asc)<br>
An ASC file is an armored ASCII file used by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), an encryption program utilized for secure communication. It contains a digitally signed message and may store plain-text written information, as well as binary information encoded as text. ASC files also include a key as clear-signed text, which can be verified using PGP authentication methods. This site is interesting because it tells me what is .asc files in brief.

8. [What is PGP Encryption and How Does It Work?](https://www.varonis.com/blog/pgp-encryption/)<br>
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption system used for both sending encrypted emails and encrypting sensitive files. Since its invention back in 1991, PGP has become the de facto standard for email security. This site is interesting to me because it tells me how PGP Encryption works

9. [Vi and Nano: Linux Text Editor](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-text-editors-vi-nano)<br>
Vi and Nano, both are Linux's default text editor. Vi is old school with a blank layout and no visible controls, which can make it difficult to work with for beginners. However, it is very powerful and once you learn the keystrokes it can be used very quickly to edit config files and used for scripts, etc. Nano has a pseudo-graphical layout that makes it a little easier to jump right into. Both are viable options. Vi is a standard whereas Nano has to be available depending on the Linux OS you use. This site is interesting to me because it tells me the comparation between Vi and Nano (I like Nano btw).

10. [What is the difference between printf, sprintf, and fprintf?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-printf-sprintf-fprintf/)<br>
printf function is used to print character stream of data on stdout console. String print function instead of printing on console store it on char buffer which are specified in sprintf. fprintf is used to print the string content in file but not on stdout console.
