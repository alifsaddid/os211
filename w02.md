1. [Who Am I](http://dl.sharemydrive.xyz/whoami-2014/)<br>
I started this week by watching this movie: Who Am I, because i think it's related to our topics (security and protection). You'll see some hAcKIng (idk hehe) techniques in this movie such as phising, evil twin, and some social engineering. 

2. [9 Common Hacking Techniques](https://blog.finjan.com/9-common-hacking-techniques-and-how-to-deal-with-them/)<br>
This microblog gives you brief explanation about 9 common hacking techniques such as DDoS, Eavesdropping, Keylogging, etc. Remember, read this article only for knowledge purpose. Don't do these techniques to your friend!

3. [Password Cracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs)<br>
This youtube video tells us how easy a password to be cracked. So keep in mind that your password must have at least 8 characters, contain lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numerical characters.

4. [Most Common Password](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt)<br>
password, password1, 12345, abc, iforget, is that your password? This is a list of 10k most commonly used password in the world. Check it out to find out that your password is commonly used or not!

5. [Perbedaan SHA 1, SHA 2, SHA 256](https://sslindonesia.com/perbedaan-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256/)<br>
We have heard about SHA 1, SHA 2, and SHA 256 during our lecture, but what do they mean? SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is hashing algorithm that usually used for digital signatures. There are also SHA-384 and SHA-512 as well that must be interesting to learn. 

6. [Cryptography](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html)<br>
Cryptography, or the science of secret writing, is an ancient art. The first documented use of cryptography in writing dates back to circa 1900 B.C. when an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in an inscription. In data and telecommunications, crypthography is necessary when communicating over any untrusted medium, which includes just about any network, particularly the internet. There are three types of cryptographic algorithms, Secret Key Cryptography (SKC), Public Key Cryptography (PKC), Hash Functions. The three types encryption techniques are optimized for some specific cryptographic application(s).

7. [Top 8 Strongest Data Encryption Algorithms in Cryptography](https://acodez.in/data-encryption-algorithms/)<br>
There are a lot of encryption algorithms that can be used to secure information. This article explains us the top 8 strongest data encryption algorithm.

8. [Pointers in C Programming](https://www.guru99.com/c-pointers.html)<br>
If you are confused about the concepts of pointer in C language, this article is good to read. It also explains the advantages & disadvantages of using pointers.

9. [Linux chmod command tutorial for beginners](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/linux-chmod-command/)<br>
